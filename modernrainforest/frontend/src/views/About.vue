          Hi.there! This is Cheng Chen. I graduated in the September of 2020 from the University of Californai Irvine, with my degree of B.S and a major in Mathmatics</p>
            <p class="org-description is-size-4"> 
            as I have been self-learning programming(frontend,backend and ML), I think it would be a good idea to build something that involves several developing philosophy 
            like separation of front-end and backend, microservices, stateless along the way, </p>
            <p>and that is why you would see the website you are visiting right now.</p>
            <p>The plan I have in mind right now is to build this to be a e-commerce website,
            mainly selling merchandizes that I have crash on. </p>

            <p>The website is built under the help of great techniques such as
            Vue,Vuex,Vuetify, Fastapi, Postgresql, Elastic Search, Redis, Traefik, Celery, Pytorch, Docker, Kubernetes and etc.
            Send a message to RaceyChan if you are interested in such field and would like to communicate, or just to say hi ;)
